        "Book is not about Hard Truth abt Life n Startups .It only about Ashneer life and his Startup. The book was not that great. But I enjoyed it cos the way he has not held back in accusing people including extra marital affair allegations within senior employees with their names. I could LinkedIn their profiles and check who these ppl actually are. That made the book very interesting. Ashneer is a massive guy. His main issue was he started and grew the company without a strong founding team started with some 2nd yr students from IIT Delhi who couldnt be given CXO positions. So he ended up hiring CXOs and all of them with help of Sequoia ganged up against him.",

        "I would give this book to everyone I know if I could. It's that well written! I find it so helpful to show you ways to rethink, listen well, communicate non verbally, and use your time solo in deep contemplation, spend better quality time with other people you meet in your life. Learn how to heal yourself, work towards finding more purpose in your life, listen to your own inner voice, feel better on all levels, and ultimately make this world a more humane and inspirational place to live for all of us.",

Morgan's insight and examination is wonderful and made me feel like I was back in the sociology/psychology classroom but with real world applicability; this book will motivate you to take action. Can't wait to read this one again soon.",

        "“Holly” by Stephen King is a book I’ve been waiting a very long time to finally read. You see, before “Holly” was officially published on 9/5/23, I went on a Holly-inspired reading marathon so I could jump in and be fully caught up. I’m talking about taking an entire week off of work to enjoy a BOOKcation with everything involving Holly. That’s right ladies and gentlemen, I devoured four novels and an entire short story collection written by King that featured Holly and it was such a rewarding reading experience.",
